🎵 Hackathon: ML Model for Song Prediction
Have you ever felt like your music taste is a reflection of your soul? In this project, we set out to decode that feeling — using machine learning.

🧠 Project Overview
This machine learning project was built as part of a hackathon challenge to predict what kind of music people like based on various input features. The goal was to understand listening behavior and recommend songs or genres that resonate personally with users.

🚀 What We Built
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and normalized a dataset containing user preferences, song metadata (genre, mood, tempo, etc.), and historical behavior.

Modeling: Tested various ML algorithms, including:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

KNN for similarity-based recommendation

Evaluation:

Achieved promising accuracy scores on classification models.

Used F1-score and precision-recall for imbalanced preference data.

Song Recommendation:

Final model outputs the most likely preferred genre/song per user.

Includes an option to generate a mini playlist.

🧰 Tech Stack
Python

Pandas & NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for EDA)

Jupyter Notebook

📌 Future Improvements
Integrate Spotify API for real-time song metadata and playlist generation.

Apply NLP to analyze song lyrics and mood mapping.

Enhance personalization using deep learning (e.g., RNNs or Transformers).

🤝 Team & Credits
Built during a 48-hour hackathon with a focus on collaboration, creativity, and pushing the limits of AI in music personalization.

💬 Inspiration
“Music taste always felt so personal — like if someone judged your playlist, they were really judging your soul.”

We turned that sentiment into a data-driven experiment.
