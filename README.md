🎶 Hackathon Project: ML Model for Song Preference Prediction

What kind of music do people love and why?
Music taste often feels deeply personal, like a mirror of the soul. This project explores how machine learning can capture that essence by predicting individual music preferences based on user behavior and song features.

📍 Project Summary
This project was developed during a hackathon to build a machine-learning model that predicts a person’s music taste. By analyzing user data and audio features, we aimed to classify preferred genres and recommend songs that match individual listening styles.

🔍 Key Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
We structured raw user data and song metadata, including attributes such as mood, genre, tempo, and artist popularity.

Exploratory Data Analysis
We identified patterns in user preferences, listening frequency, and genre clusters using visual tools such as Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Model Development
We trained and evaluated multiple models, including:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for similarity-based recommendations

Recommendation Engine
The final pipeline suggests genres or songs a user is most likely to enjoy based on learned patterns.

🧠 Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, seaborn, matplotlib.

Tools: Jupyter Notebook

📈 Results

Achieved strong performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score) in multi-class classification tasks.

Demonstrated how audio and user features can be effectively mapped to individual music preferences.

🔄 Future Scope

Spotify API Integration: Dynamically recommend tracks and create real-time playlists.

Lyrics & Sentiment Analysis: Use NLP to align user moods with lyrical themes.

Deep Learning Models: Explore RNNs or Transformer-based models for enhanced context understanding.

👥 Team & Collaboration
This project was built during a fast-paced 48-hour hackathon challenge. Our team brought together individuals with diverse expertise spanning data analysis, machine learning, software development, and creative design. We collaborated using Git and GitHub for version control, divided tasks efficiently, and held regular checkpoints to stay aligned. Despite the time constraints, we delivered a functional and insightful music preference prediction model by combining our strengths and maintaining clear communication and shared goals.
