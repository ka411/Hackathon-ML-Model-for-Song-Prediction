🎶 Hackathon Project: ML Model for Song Preference Prediction

What kind of music do people love—and why?
Music taste often feels deeply personal, like a mirror of the soul. This project explores how machine learning can capture that essence by predicting individual music preferences based on user behavior and song features.

📍 Project Summary
This project was developed during a hackathon with the goal of building a machine learning model that predicts a person’s music taste. By analyzing user data and audio features, we aimed to classify preferred genres and recommend songs that match individual listening styles.

🔍 Key Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
We structured raw user data and song metadata, including attributes such as mood, genre, tempo, and artist popularity.

Exploratory Data Analysis
We identified patterns in user preferences, listening frequency, and genre clusters using visual tools such as Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Model Development
We trained and evaluated multiple models, including:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for similarity-based recommendations

Recommendation Engine
The final pipeline suggests genres or songs a user is most likely to enjoy based on learned patterns.
