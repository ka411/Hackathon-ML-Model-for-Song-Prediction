🎶Hackathon Project: ML Model for Song Preference Prediction
What kind of music do people love and why?
Music taste often feels deeply personal, like a mirror of the soul. This project explores how machine learning can capture that essence by predicting individual music preferences based on user behavior and song features.

📍Project Summary
This project was developed during a hackathon to build a machine learning model that predicts a person’s music taste. By analyzing user data and audio features, we aimed to classify preferred genres and recommend songs that match individual listening styles.

🔍Key Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Structured raw user data and song metadata, including mood, genre, tempo, and artist popularity.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Uncovered patterns in user preferences, listening frequency, and genre clusters using visual tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Model Development
Trained and evaluated multiple models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for similarity-based recommendation

Recommendation Engine
The final pipeline suggests genres or songs a user will most likely enjoy based on learned patterns.

🧠Tech Stack
Languages: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, seaborn, matplotlib

Tools: Jupyter Notebook

📈Results
Achieved strong performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score) in multi-class classification tasks.

Demonstrated how audio and user features can be effectively mapped to preferences.

🔄Future Scope
Spotify API Integration: Dynamically recommend tracks and create real-time playlists.

Lyrics & Sentiment Analysis: Use NLP to align user mood with lyrical themes.

Deep Learning Models: Consider using RNNs or Transformer-based models for enhanced context understanding.

👥 Team & Collaboration
This project was built as part of a fast-paced, 48-hour hackathon challenge. Our team brought together individuals with diverse expertise — from data analysis and machine learning to software development and creative design. We collaborated using Git and GitHub for version control, divided tasks efficiently, and held regular checkpoints to stay aligned. Despite the time constraints, we delivered a functional and insightful music preference prediction model by combining our strengths and working with clear communication and shared goals.

💭 Final Thought
“If someone judges your playlist, it often feels like they’re judging your soul."
We wanted to build a model that understands, rather than judges.
